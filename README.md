I'm a 11 year old girl and I'm studying *Learn Python The Hard Way (Its Chinese edition name is 笨办法学 Python)*

* I plan to finish the book in my winter holidays.  
* I'm using *Pycharm* and *Python 3.6.1* on my MacBook Air. 

I'll switch to *neovim* to have a taste of vim.

### Go, Go, Go, Sue. You can do it.
